            <p>The first operating system publicly released by the company was a variant of Unix announced on August 25,
                1980. Acquired from AT&T through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it Xenix, and hired Santa Cruz
                Operation in order to port/adapt the operating system to several platforms.[20][21] This Unix variant 
                would become home to the first version of Microsoft's word processor, Microsoft Word. Originally
                titled "Multi-Tool Word", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of "What You See Is What You Get",
                or WYSIWYG pioneered by the Xerox Alto and the Bravo text editor in the 1970s.[22][23]

                Word was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were
                bundled with the November 1983 issue of PC World, making it one of the first programs to be distributed
                on-disk with a magazine. (Earlier magazine on-disk distributions included Robert Uiterwyk's BASIC in 
                the May 1977 issue of Information Age.)[24][25] However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly 
                although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version 
                of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it[26] (note that Unix is a multi-user operating 
                system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had 
                gotten out of the Unix business, except for its ownership stake in SCO.[20]</p>
